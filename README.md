# SpeechRecognition-Assistant-Python

This is Very popular and intresting project for beginners & newbie programmer. As we know Python is a suitable language for script writers and developers. Let’s write a script for Personal Voice Assistant using Python. So I thought it would be cool to create a personal assistant in python (Not Like Jarvis Shit! , Its just a speech recognition thing). For the SpeechRecognitions, you need to use/download SpeechRecognition Script from PyPi Store using PIP & many more scripts that I listed in #requirements.txt . 

The implemented assistant can open up the application (if it’s installed in the system), search Google, Wikipedia and YouTube about the query etc by just giving the voice command. You can process the data as per the need or can add the functionality, depends upon how we code things. Iam using Google speech recognition API and google text to speech for voice input and output respectively.

Now that you’ve got everything you need, let’s take a look at Devprogramming Brain which is basically the code written by Shivam Sharma[https://www.github.com/shivamksharma]. You can assemble the above-mentioned resources to create your own AI assistant. you can get things done after few hours of work and research, If You do this your own.


-> gTTS – Google Text To Speech, for converting the given text to speech
-> speech_recognition – for recognizing the voice command and converting to text
-> pyttsx3 - it is text-to-speech conversion library in Python, its works offline.
-> PyObjC - it is a bridge between Python and Objective-C
-> yfinance - its Pythonic way to download historical market data from Yahoo!   finance.
-> pylint - it is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions.
-> playsound – for playing the saved audio file.
-> pyaudio – for voice engine in python

Thats It - Build Your Own AI Assistant
